**General**<br>
I created these Rust crates originally:<br>
[itertools](https://docs.rs/itertools),
[ndarray](https://docs.rs/ndarray),
[petgraph](https://docs.rs/petgraph),
[indexmap](https://docs.rs/indexmap),
[matrixmultiply](https://docs.rs/matrixmultiply),
and others.<br>
Some of them are now maintained by new owners or maintainers.
